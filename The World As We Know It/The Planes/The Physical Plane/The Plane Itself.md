# The Plane Itself

The Physical Plane is as you’d expect, it’s everything physical in the 3rd dimension that’s constantly traveling through time. 

The dominant species in the physical plane is humanity, the Physical Plane is not much different from the world you know, the geography is similar. The main difference is in the history of the Plane.

## The History
The history of this plane is much the same as the world you know. The only differences are the technology that is currently used. Due to an event known as the Catastrophe, the progress of the world has slowed down significantly. Across most of the plane society is just under 100 years behind in technological advancements except for a few continue this later

history is pretty normal, aside from the fact that they are about 100 years behind in most locations due to the catastrophic event that happened around 200 years ago that left around 50k people remaining. one of which was The One Who Understood.

#### The Catastrophe
clean up as well:
an eldritch being managed to cross into the Physical plane due to the cosmic leeches that had eroded arcadia completely. This caused an erasure of around 99% of the world and left only around 50k humans surviving, none of whom remember anything about it due to the memory erasing property of the eldritch. this event is only known to those who understand from the story told by the one who understood. the eldritch being was eventually forced back into the realm beyond reason by the gift giver, who is now "deceased" and one with arcadia along with the one who understood.

# The Plane Itself

The Physical Plane is as you’d expect, it’s everything physical in the 3rd dimension that’s constantly traveling through time. 

The dominant species in the physical plane is humanity, the Physical Plane is not much different from the world you know, the geography is similar. The main difference is in the history of the Plane.

## The History
The history of this plane is much the same as the world you know. The only differences are the technology that is currently used. Due to an event known as Day Zero, the progress of the world has slowed down significantly. Across most of the plane society is just under 100 years behind in technological advancements except for a few remote areas that were unaffected by Day Zero. These areas were distal parts of the world, furthest away from [the Citadel]. 

#### Day Zero
Estimated Time Of Occurence: 200 Years Ago.

Around 200 years ago one of the Eldritch managed to cross over into the Physical Plane due to the fact that at the Citadel, [Arcadia] had eroded completely due to the [Cosmic Leeches] that had accumulated in the Metaphysical Realm and depleted the entirety of Arcadia in the area. This depletion allowed for the first known occurence of any entity crossing Arcadia. This entity, known as [The Realmwalker], had crossed Arcadia into the Physical Plane. Due to it being an entity beyond comprehension, that does not follow the same laws of physics, time or reality as the Physical Plane, its presence started Day Zero. Reality began overwriting itself to match that of the Realmwalker as, being an entity of a higher dimension, its presence was enough to fundamentally change the laws of physics around it. This created a cascading effect as it radiated out from the epicenter.

The world was doomed.

A second entity crossed Arcadia. An Eldritch known as [The Dreamer]. This Eldritch is believed to have been the strongest Eldritch in existance. Presumably the Dreamer used its power on saving the Physical Plane, but in this act, it sacrificed itself. 

This caused an erasure of around 99% of the world and left only around 50k humans surviving, none of whom remember anything about it due to the memory erasing property of the eldritch. this event is only known to those who understand from the story told by the one who understood. the eldritch being was eventually forced back into the realm beyond reason by the gift giver, who is now "deceased" and one with arcadia along with the one who understood.

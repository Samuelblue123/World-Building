There are no known inhabitants of the Metaphysical Realm...

However...

That does not mean there are no inhabitants of the [[The World As We Know It/The Planes/The Metaphysical Realm/The Realm Itself|The Realm Itself]]...

[[Those Who Understand]] seem to think that there are inhabitants of the Metaphysical Realm. They believe that there are creatures that live within the realm that cause [[The World As We Know It/The Planes/The Metaphysical Realm/The Realm Itself#Arcadia Rifts|Arcadia Rifts]].

### Cosmic Leeches
These are presumed to be cosmic leeches that drain the energy contained within [[The World As We Know It/The Planes/The Metaphysical Realm/The Realm Itself|Arcadia]], weakening the boundary and blurring the lines between [[The World As We Know It/The Planes/The Realm Beyond Reason/The Realm Itself|The Realm Beyond Reason]] and [[The Plane Itself|the Physical Plane]].

They are also believed to leave behind [[The World As We Know It/The Planes/The Metaphysical Realm/The Realm Itself#Remnant Energy|Remnant Energy]] as waste product. This is the assumed reason for attraction that [[The Eldritch In General|the Eldritch]] have to Arcadia Rifts. The reason for the [[Humanity|Human]] attraction to Arcadia Rifts is speculated to be that the presence of the Eldritch causes a compulsion to be in their area and behold them.

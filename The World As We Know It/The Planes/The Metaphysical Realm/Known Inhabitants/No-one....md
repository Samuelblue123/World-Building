# No-one...

There are no known inhabitants of the Metaphysical Realm...

However...

That does not mean there are no inhabitants of the [The Realm Itself](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/blob/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Metaphysical%20Realm/The%20Realm%20Itself.md)...

[Those Who Understand](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/edit/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Metaphysical%20Realm/Known%20Inhabitants/No-one....md) seem to think that there are inhabitants of the Metaphysical Realm. They believe that there are creatures that live within the realm that cause [Arcadia Rifts](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/blob/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Metaphysical%20Realm/The%20Realm%20Itself.md#arcadia-rifts).

### Cosmic Leeches
These are presumed to be cosmic leeches that drain the energy contained within Arcadia, weakening the boundary and blurring the lines between [The Realm Beyond Reason](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/blob/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Realm%20Beyond%20Reason/The%20Realm%20Itself.md) and [the Physical Plane](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/blob/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Physical%20Plane/The%20Plane%20Itself.md).

They are also believed to leave behind [Remnant Energy](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/blob/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Metaphysical%20Realm/The%20Realm%20Itself.md#remnant-energy) as waste product. This is the assumed reason for attraction that [the Eldritch](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/blob/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Realm%20Beyond%20Reason/Known%20Inhabitants/The%20Eldritch%20In%20General.md) have to Arcadia Rifts. The reason for the [Human](https://github.com/Samuelblue123/World-Building/blob/main/The%20World%20As%20We%20Know%20It/The%20Planes/The%20Physical%20Plane/Notable%20Groups%20or%20Individuals/Humanity.md) attraction to Arcadia Rifts is speculated to be that the presence of the Eldritch causes a compulsion to be in their area and behold them.

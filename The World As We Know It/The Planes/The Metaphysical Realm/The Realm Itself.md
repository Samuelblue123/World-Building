# The Realm Itself

There is a boundary between realms, a one-way mirror of sorts known as Arcadia. Arcadia is the veil between the Physical Plane and the Realm Beyond Reason, and maybe others yet to be discovered.

The one-way mirror description comes from the fact that those who inhabit the Realm Beyond Reason are fully able to see into the Physical Plane, however, those who inhabit the Physical Plane cannot see into the Realm Beyond Reason. Except for Those Who Understand as well as locations known as Arcadia Rifts.

### Arcadia Rifts
In certain locations the veil between realms is weaker than others, Arcadia Rifts. These can be described as holes in the mirror where those in the Physical Plane are capable of seeing into the Realm Beyond Reason, but only a small area. It's as if you're looking through a pin-hole in a mile wide canvas. One such known location is The Valley. 

A strange phenomenon noticed by Those Who Understand is that both the Eldritch and humans seem to be attracted to these Arcadia Rifts, for reasons not yet understood but speculated upon.

### Remnant Energy
Remnant Energy is an assumed byproduct of cosmic leeches. This substance then manifests itself in the Realm Beyond Reason and would act as a way for the Eldritch to preserve their lives and increase their lifespans. This is, however, all conjecture on behalf of Those Who Understand in an attempt to rationalize the motives of beings whom we cannot fathom to understand.

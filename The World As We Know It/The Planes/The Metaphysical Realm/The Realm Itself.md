# The Realm Itself

There is a boundary between realms, a one-way mirror of sorts known as Arcadia. Arcadia is the veil between the Physical Plane and the Realm Beyond Reason, and maybe others yet to be discovered.

The one-way mirror description comes from the fact that those who inhabit the Realm Beyond Reason are fully able to see into the Physical Plane, however, those who inhabit the Physical Plane cannot see into the Realm Beyond Reason. Except for Those Who Understand as well as locations known as Arcadia Rifts.

### Arcadia Rifts
In certain locations the veil between realms is weaker than others, Arcadia Rifts. These can be described as holes in the mirror where those in the Physical Plane are capable of seeing into the Realm Beyond Reason, but only a small area. It's as if you're looking through a pin-hole in a mile wide canvas. One such known location is The Valley. 

A strange phenomenon noticed by Those Who Understand is that both the Eldritch and humans seem to be attracted to these Arcadia Rifts, for reasons not yet understood.

### Remnant Energy
clean up but
remnant energy is the waste product of cosmic leeches that acts as a lifeforce for the Eldritch(link).

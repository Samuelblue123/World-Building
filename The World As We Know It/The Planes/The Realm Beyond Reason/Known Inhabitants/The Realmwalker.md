# The Realmwalker
The Realmwalker is the first known entity to have passed through [Arcadia], causing the events of [Day Zero]. The Realmwalker, however, no longer exists. It was overpowered by [The Dreamer] and forcibly fused with Arcadia along with The Dreamer itself in an attempt to repair Arcadia.

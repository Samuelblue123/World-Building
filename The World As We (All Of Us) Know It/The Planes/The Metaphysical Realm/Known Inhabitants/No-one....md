# No-one...

There are no known inhabitants of the Metaphysical Realm...

However...

That does not mean there are no inhabitants of the [The Realm Itself]...

[Those Who Understand] seem to think that there are inhabitants of the Metaphysical Realm. They believe that there are creatures that live within the realm that cause [Arcadia Rifts].

### Cosmic Leeches
There are presumed to be cosmic leeches that drain the energy contained within Arcadia, weakening the boundary and blurring the lines between [The Realm Beyond Reason] and [the Physical Plane].

They are also believed to leave behind [Remnant Energy] as waste product. This is the assumed reason for attraction that [the Eldritch] have to Arcadia Rifts. The reason for the [Human] attraction to Arcadia Rifts is speculated to be that the presence of the Eldritch causes a compulsion to be in their area and behold them.
